perl-quiz
=========

A collection of perl fragments I wrote when moving from perl 4 to perl
5.  I had the pleasure of spending a few hours with Randall Schwartz
in the late 90's.  I showed him the quiz and managed to stump him on
two.  I can't remember which two, unfortunately.  He did answer the
other questions with blinding speed.  Enjoy!
